# Pomodoro Timer

This project is a Pomodoro timer application implemented using Python's Tkinter library. It helps users manage their time efficiently by following the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that alternates work sessions with short breaks.

## Overview

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple and effective tool designed to improve productivity by breaking down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This project provides a graphical interface for the timer, allowing users to start, pause, and reset their sessions.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Built using Tkinter, the application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing work and break sessions.
- **Customizable Timer:** Users can adjust the length of work and break sessions.
- **Visual and Audio Alerts:** The timer alerts the user when it's time to take a break or get back to work.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need Python installed on your system. Tkinter is included with Python, so no additional installation is required.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Run the main Python file to start the application.
3. Use the start button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
4. The timer will alternate between work and break sessions.
5. The reset button allows you to reset the timer at any point.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Files Description

- **main.py:** The main file that contains the logic for the Pomodoro timer, including the Tkinter GUI setup and the timer functionality.

## Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. After four sessions, a longer break is taken. This method is designed to improve focus and productivity.
